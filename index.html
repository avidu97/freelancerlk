            A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a
            service by an Internet hosting service. The virtual dedicated server
            (VDS) also works in a virtualized environment but some CPU cores are
            dedicated for it, which is not the case with VPS.

            Summary. A good VPS Is A bit More expensive than other VPS servers
            because it has stable and powerful hardware with Raid SSD storage.
            Sometimes it can be more expensive because of its license or the
            quality and technology of the virtualization system.

            How Much Does VPS Hosting Cost? As a result of VPS hosting's hybrid
            nature, its cost isn't quite as low as shared hosts' fees, but it's
            not nearly as high as dedicated hosts' fees. You can expect to
            pay between $20 per month and $100 per month, depending on the
            configuration.

            A VPS hosting plan is almost always going to be faster than a shared
            hosting plan simply because your users don't have to queue up with
            other sites' visitors to access yours.

            In theory, a VPS should give you better loading speeds, more
            reliability, and greater control, at a lower price than a dedicated
            server.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            As the VPS is a server in its own right it comes with all the
            security vulnerabilities of any other 'non-virtual' server. This
            means that a VPS is no more or less secure than running a dedicated
            server. Disable superuser logins to the server, and only allow
            normal users to log in who must then request superuser access.
